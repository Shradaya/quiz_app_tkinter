            "explanation": "In a relational database, a primary key uniquely identifies each record (or row) in a table. It must be unique and not null for each record. A foreign key, on the other hand, is a column or combination of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables, enforcing referential integrity and allowing data to be linked across tables."
